Stretching the Boundaries of Traditional Key Protection
Unbound Key Control (UKC) ensures that your most sensitive keys never exist in the clear at any point in their lifecycle – not even when generated, while in use or while at rest. With Unbound’s Distributed Trust Platform, key material is never whole – not in memory, disk or network.

By eliminating this single point of compromise, UKC can stretch the secure boundary far beyond the traditional physical casing.

Virtualize Key Control with our NextGen vHSM®
Manage your keys, automate them, and operate them – from anywhere.

Unbound’s NextGen vHSM® provides the same security as traditional HSM systems – with none of the operational headaches.
